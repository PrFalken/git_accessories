A tiny little repo of tiny little helper scripts for git.

git-who

Usage: git-who <filepath> [-v]

Passing it just a file path will give you an unordered list of the people who have worked on it. Ex.:
   foo.sh: Bob Smith, Mary Smith, Tom Jones

Adding -v lists out the names of the people who have touched it, in order. Ex.: 

   foo.sh: Bob Smith, Mary Smith, Bob Smith, Tom Jones, Bob Smith
